I created a Power Apps canvas app that you can use to view your Microsoft Planner tasks on a Gantt Chart. You can use it freely and make modifications to your version.

All major features of the app are presented in my blog post at: https://terhoantila.com/2021/05/17/microsoft-planner-gantt-chart-with-power-apps-download-your-own
